This can be used e.g. to track the number\r of elements in a mapping, issuing ERC721 ids, or counting request ids.\r  * Include with `using Counters for Counters.Counter;`\r Since it is not possible to overflow a 256 bit integer with increments of one, `increment` can skip the SafeMath\r overflow check, thereby saving gas. This does assume however correct usage, in that the underlying `_value` is never\r directly accessed.\r",
